Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467529/CinemaKhan/TheLordOfTheRings_zscjau.jpg","ImdbRating":"6.9","Price":"7.00","Subtitle":"Azerbaijani","Session":{"Id":"cbf1a6d1-3c92-49a1-8715-bf3e96cf1ffe","Cinema":"Sumgayit","Hall":"Access Bank","Date":"11/15/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"22:55:00","Price":"7.00"},"BusySeats":[45,63,13,32,42,51,62,44,48,60,47,80,29,34,8,79,73,6,4,28,40,85,58,61,27,59,54,86,68,36,33,19,0,84,12,38,35,1,14,72,57,9,3]},{"Id":"a6351735-aab8-4ed9-88fd-cad49636271a","Title":"The Sandman","Year":"2022–","Released":"05 Aug 2022","Runtime":"100 min","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Director":"N/A","Writer":"Neil Gaiman, David S.
