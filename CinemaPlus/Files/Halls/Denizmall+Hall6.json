Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467529/CinemaKhan/TheLordOfTheRings_zscjau.jpg","ImdbRating":"6.9","Price":"7.00","Subtitle":"Azerbaijani","Session":{"Id":"11db37ce-81ed-4fb5-8aa7-8ab26a619829","Cinema":"Deniz mall","Hall":"Hall 6","Date":"11/18/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"21:45:00","Price":"7.00"},"BusySeats":[28,33,68,56,46,50,69,25,7,19,13,54,10,1,74,64,47,84,79,6,2,40,89,3,82,37,59,57,29,73,42,52,31,86,43,62,35,45,67,75,72,27,49,48,14,21,39,15,87,18,4,32,5]}]
