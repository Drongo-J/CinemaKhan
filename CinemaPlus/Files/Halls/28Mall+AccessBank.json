Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467529/CinemaKhan/TheLordOfTheRings_zscjau.jpg","ImdbRating":"6.9","Price":"7.00","Subtitle":"Azerbaijani","Session":{"Id":"3d6f8725-640c-4b10-be6c-e9b6fa9c9b8a","Cinema":"28 Mall","Hall":"Access Bank","Date":"11/12/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"18:40:00","Price":"7.00"},"BusySeats":[50,24,25,53,52,79,88,39,56,58,26,66,76,54,38,12,1,43,83,60,17,59,42,84,78,27,89,85,20,28,48,74,47,82]},{"Id":"c6a7c401-e346-4ffc-8578-49bf9787eb3f","Title":"Nope","Year":"2022","Released":"22 Jul 2022","Runtime":"130 min","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Director":"Jordan Peele","Writer":"Jordan Peele","Actors":"Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Brandon Perea","Plot":"The residents of a lonely gulch in inland California bear witness to an uncanny and chilling discovery.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"1 win & 7 nominations","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467527/CinemaKhan/Nope_stqlqt.jpg","ImdbRating":"7.0","Price":"7.00","Subtitle":"Turkish","Session":{"Id":"47304947-1753-41ed-bd0c-14d6dade2021","Cinema":"28 Mall","Hall":"Access Bank","Date":"11/13/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"16:20:00","Price":"7.00"},"BusySeats":[0,47,68,1,9,13,88,86,38,6]},{"Id":"55713341-29ec-461d-9427-92b7b3f58d78","Title":"Rogue Agent","Year":"2022","Released":"27 Jul 2022","Runtime":"115 min","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Director":"Declan Lawn, Adam Patterson","Writer":"Michael Bronner, Adam Patterson, Declan Lawn","Actors":"James Norton, Matthew Douglas, Rob Malone","Plot":"The extraordinary and chilling story of career conman Robert Freegard who masqueraded as an MI5 agent and fooled people into going into hiding, and the woman who fell for him, and then brought him down.","Language":"English","Country":"United Kingdom","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467534/CinemaKhan/RogueAgent_uxtvuo.jpg","ImdbRating":"6.3","Price":"6.00","Subtitle":"Azerbaijani","Session":{"Id":"233b7508-425e-4d05-9031-853686a5db2d","Cinema":"28 Mall","Hall":"Access Bank","Date":"11/13/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"18:40:00","Price":"6.00"},"BusySeats":[22,77,58,6,57,11,59,0,61,40,62,38,88,18,2,69,34,46,65,39,83,13,14,16,49,29,86,80,82,37,79,72,26,25,3]},{"Id":"4fc35a1e-d4f5-4f6a-99f1-6c9b46396df2","Title":"The Man from Toronto","Year":"2022","Released":"24 Jun 2022","Runtime":"110 min","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Director":"Patrick Hughes","Writer":"Robbie Fox, Chris Bremner, Jason Blumenthal","Actors":"Kevin Hart, Woody Harrelson, Jasmine Mathews","Plot":"The world's deadliest assassin and New York's biggest screw-up are mistaken for each other at an Airbnb rental.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467529/CinemaKhan/TheManFromToronto_aafb6y.jpg","ImdbRating":"5.8","Price":"6.00","Subtitle":"Turkish","Session":{"Id":"a4f6b06c-2f14-4274-be99-d9fa89901785","Cinema":"28 Mall","Hall":"Access Bank","Date":"11/12/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"23:50:00","Price":"6.00"},"BusySeats":[11,86,16,3,51,73,60,8,29,63,44,81,7,64,72,48,24,49,82,5,80,20,21,38,90,36,53,33,66,76,31,55,18,88,25,35,23,26]},{"Id":"46e97951-d71c-4792-8bda-d9ba2298bdab","Title":"I Came By","Year":"2022","Released":"31 Aug 2022","Runtime":"110 min","Genre":"Thriller","Director":"Babak Anvari","Writer":"Babak Anvari, Namsi Khan","Actors":"Antonio Aakeel, Alicia Ambrose-Bayly, Percelle Ascott","Plot":"Follows a young graffiti artist who discovers a shocking secret that would put him and the ones closest to him in danger.","Language":"English","Country":"United Kingdom","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467537/CinemaKhan/ICameBy_tqwfdp.jpg","ImdbRating":"6.1","Price":"6.00","Subtitle":"Azerbaijani","Session":{"Id":"22e963e2-ffff-4275-b31f-7669217aed96","Cinema":"28 Mall","Hall":"Access Bank","Date":"11/16/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"20:15:00","Price":"6.00"},"BusySeats":[61,63,66,55,36,27,60,39,64,33,87,17,31,43,84,71,45,88,3,2,41,5,50,25,49,30,9]},{"Id":"720bc0ed-deed-4b5d-abd1-45a4f371a6ca","Title":"Three Thousand Years of Longing","Year":"2022","Released":"26 Aug 2022","Runtime":"108 min","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Director":"George Miller","Writer":"George Miller, Augusta Gore, A.S.
