He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 3 Oscars. 31 wins & 30 nominations total","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467530/CinemaKhan/TheGodfather_vp4d4h.jpg","ImdbRating":"9.2","Price":"10.00","Subtitle":"Turkish","Session":{"Id":"7a7e5d19-8090-4700-8503-8d408c22bdf2","Cinema":"Khamsa Park","Hall":"PAŞA Həyat","Date":"11/14/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"19:40:00","Price":"10.00"},"BusySeats":[45,47,83,90,64,67,60,17,65,36,62,44,52,82,14,54,53,81,61,57,0,11,85,25,8,75,78,77,27,20,63,51,9,39,28,80,10]},{"Id":"720bc0ed-deed-4b5d-abd1-45a4f371a6ca","Title":"Three Thousand Years of Longing","Year":"2022","Released":"26 Aug 2022","Runtime":"108 min","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Director":"George Miller","Writer":"George Miller, Augusta Gore, A.S.
