Payne","Actors":"Morfydd Clark, Ismael Cruz Cordova, Markella Kavenagh","Plot":"This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbriqxpaa/image/upload/v1683467529/CinemaKhan/TheLordOfTheRings_zscjau.jpg","ImdbRating":"6.9","Price":"7.00","Subtitle":"Azerbaijani","Session":{"Id":"12b14d9d-a6bf-43de-999a-fe1743512bdc","Cinema":"Nakhchivan","Hall":"Hall 7","Date":"11/18/2022 12:00:00 AM","Time":"21:05:00","Price":"7.00"},"BusySeats":[7,0,60,63,43,3,10,30,26,27,34,52,13,67,1,77,22,36,80,9,65,86,32,68,11,2,12,75,47,53,55,50,66,24,71,90,49,51,25,76,28,73,58,61,54,69,14,88,85,56,41,83,38,21]},{"Id":"fedd6bbd-e655-400f-983a-d5e1bf24f6e4","Title":"Interview with the Vampire","Year":"2022","Released":"11 Nov 1994","Runtime":"123 min","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Director":"Neil Jordan","Writer":"Anne Rice","Actors":"Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas","Plot":"Against the backdrop of a gloomy San Francisco, the nearly two-century-old vampire, Louis de Pointe du Lac, recounts the unbelievable story of his eternal transformation and a life worse than death to the sceptic reporter, Daniel Molloy.
